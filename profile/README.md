## Hi there 👋

J.A.R.V.I.S

A brief description of your project

Every team member should have a brief bio (one small paragraph.)

Emily Marron: I am a student of Data Science at EMU. I am graduating in April 2024. I have experience in adapting cutting-edge ML models (particularly image-based models) for end-users using component based development. I'm good with Python, R, Java, C++, etc., but am always looking to learn more languages. My personal projects are mostly in video game modding and I take commissions from there from time to time.
