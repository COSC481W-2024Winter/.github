# J.A.R.V.I.S
JARVIS is a Flutter-based phone app AI assistant designed to help people handle all their daily tasks like a human assistant, allowing them to focus more on important matters. The software may include, but is not limited to, summarizing and sending emails, assisting users in answering and making phone calls, and helping with the payment of utilities and insurance bills, among other tasks. Just as the name JARVIS suggests, we aim to make this software a comprehensive AI assistant like JARVIS in Iron Man, helping Tony Stark solve problems and manage daily activities.

### [Emily Marron](https://github.com/emarron) - Deputy Team Leader

I am a student of Data Science at EMU. I am graduating in April 2024. I have experience in adapting cutting-edge ML models (particularly image-based models) for end-users using component based development. I'm good with Python, R, Java, C++, etc., but am always looking to learn more languages. My personal projects are mostly in video game modding and I take commissions from there from time to time.
